# estimate_error

The purpose of this project is to measure the amount of error when usng the trapezodidal or Simpson rule when calculating the solution to a first order differential equation. 

simpson.m


This code uses the composite Trapezoidal rule to calculat int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx. The error is calculated using the exact solution.
